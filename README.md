## Credential Nexus - Password Extraction & Management Tool

### üõ°Ô∏è Overview
Credential Nexus is a command-line tool designed to securely extract, decrypt, and manage saved login credentials from various sources, including Google Chrome, Discord, and Firefox. It provides robust decryption capabilities using AES-GCM and Windows DPAPI, offering comprehensive password recovery and storage functionality.

### ‚ú® Key Features
- **Multi-Source Extraction**: Retrieves passwords from Chrome, Discord, and Firefox.
- **Advanced Decryption**: Employs AES-GCM (v10/v11) and DPAPI for strong password decryption.
- **Secure Storage**: Saves extracted passwords in an encrypted SQLite database (`stored_passwords.db`).
- **Flexible Search**: Allows searching by website, username, or source within stored credentials.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a command-line menu for easy navigation and operation.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements detailed logging and exception handling for reliable performance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture
Credential Nexus operates through the following key steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition**: Copies the relevant login data files (e.g., "Login Data" from Chrome).
2.  **Database Connection**: Establishes connections to source databases and the storage database.
3.  **Key Extraction**: Retrieves the encryption key from Chrome's "Local State" file using Windows DPAPI.
4.  **Password Decryption**: Iterates through saved logins, decrypting passwords based on their encryption method.
5.  **Secure Storage**: Stores the decrypted credentials in the SQLite database, avoiding duplicates.
6.  **Search and Retrieval**: Implements search functions to locate specific passwords based on user criteria.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Ilyas-Ibrahim/Credential-Nexus.git
    cd Credential-Nexus
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### üîë Preparing Chrome's Login Data

**Before running Credential Nexus, you must copy the "Login Data" file from your Chrome profile directory to the same location as the script.**

1.  **Locate the "Login Data" file:**
    *   **Default Path (Windows):** `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data`
    *   Replace `[YourUsername]` with your actual Windows username.

2.  **Copy the File:**
    *   Ensure Chrome is closed to prevent file locking issues.
    *   Copy the `Login Data` file and place it in the same directory as the `extract_Passwords.py` script.

3.  **Multiple Profiles:**
    *   If you use multiple Chrome profiles, the "Login Data" file will be located in a profile-specific directory instead of "Default". For example:
        `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Profile 1\Login Data`
        `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Profile 2\Login Data`
    *   Copy the `Login Data` from the relevant profile if needed.

4.  **Run the Tool**

    ```bash
    python extract_Passwords.py
    ```
